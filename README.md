Developed a practical and unique software for the calculation of kinetic outcomes of a catalytic network based on computed state energies, including the turnover frequency (TOF), the turnover number (TON) and the influence of concentrations on the overall capabilities of the reaction. Where the algorithm is based on graph theory applied to chemical kinetics of catalytic networks and we are interested in providing a friendly graphical user interface.
This code has been written in Python 2. It was written by Dr Sourav Roy in collaboration with Prof Sebastian Kozuch, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.
