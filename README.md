Developed a practical and unique software for the calculation of kinetic outcomes of a catalytic network based on computed state energies, including the turnover frequency (TOF), the turnover number (TON) and the influence of concentrations on the overall capabilities of the reaction. Where the algorithm is based on graph theory applied on chemical kinetics of catalytic networks and we are interested to provide a friendly graphical user interface.
